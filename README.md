#_**Way Points**_
####By fghdx

This is a simple addon for Garry's Mod that adds waypoints to the game. It is highly commented so it will be a very easy to edit and learn from.

Way points save for each reconnection and are saved client side.

It is currently using the default derma theme. I will be creating my own theme shortly.

###How to use?
---
To install download [the zip](https://github.com/fghdx/Way-Points/archive/master.zip) and extract into your ```GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons``` folder.

In game all you need to do is use the console command "waypoints_menu" to open up the menu. If you are going to be using it a lot I suggest binding it to a key with:   
```bind [key] waypoints_menu```
