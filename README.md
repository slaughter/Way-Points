#_**Way Points**_
####By fghdx

This is a simple addon for Garry's Mod that adds waypoints to the game. It is highly commented so it will be a very easy to edit and learn from.

In the future I will make waypoints save and the marker a little bit more pretty.


It is currently using the default derma theme. I will be creating my own theme shortly.
